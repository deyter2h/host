aim, tap with 3 game, aim with horizontal line, in special case needs direct aim (expand line), types: click, hold, wave (3 clicks alt), spam one key

smooth lines change trajectory depending on arc and speed

can zoom

multiple object on one timeline: can catch them using line-net

### objects
- base (need to catch them in net, can catch multiple in the same timing, tap to confirm catching, highlight when can catch)

-below needs some kind of timing manager, so no just plain spam-
- wave (need to catch and tap in wave pattern, can start with any key and tap to every direction -> zxczxc, xczxczxc, cxzcxz) [has counter how many left]
- jack (need to catch and tap with any single key) [has counter how many left]
- drawer (presents with pattern X or star etc., each pattern has endpoints, need to draw the pattern, so each endpoint is hit) possibly attach timings to these things


### core
- sections with mania-like tapping (drop to z,x,c buttons directly)
